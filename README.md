# Snake


## What's This About? 
The repository will have to releases: a playable version, and an AI version (that will come in later). 
The playable version is a regular game of snake that you can find by googling "Snake Game".
The AI plan is it will use conditonal statements that will play a snake game as optimally as possible. By optimal, I mean quick and accurate.

## CONTROLS
Up Arrow or W:    Up
Down Arrow or S:  Down
Left Arrow or A:  Left
Right Arrow or D: Right

NOTE: Controls have not been fully implemented yet in my code, but they will work when a release comes out.

## SETUP

Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed, as well as the Pyglet library. Before a release of the game comes out, to run the game: 

- you must download the repository
- Run main.py: root directory -> Core Game -> main.py

## CONTRIBUTING

You can fork it and do your own thing, but I don't want any pull requests since this a project I'd like to do for improvement of my Python skills. Including others on this project destroys the point. It's only public so some of my friends can try it out.
