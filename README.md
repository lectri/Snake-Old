# Snake-AI
The repository will have to releases: a playable version, and an AI version (that will come in later). The playable version is a regular game of snake that you can find by googling "Snake Game". The AI plan is it will use conditonal statements that will play a snake game as optimally as possible. By optimal, I mean quick and accurate.

CONTROLS
